      This Data Processing Addendum (“<b>Addendum</b>”) is between the RECON-AI
      entity specified on the signature line below (or if this Addendum is being
      incorporated by reference, the RECON-AI entity identified on the
      applicable RECON-AI quote) (“<b>RECON-AI</b>”) and the customer
      entity(ies) specified on the signature line below (or if this Addendum is
      being incorporated by reference, the customer entity identified on the
      applicable RECON-AI quote) (“<b>Customer</b>”). This Addendum amends and
      forms part of the service agreement(s) between the parties that reference
      this Addendum (including, without limitation, the RECON-AI Maintenance And
      Support Terms and the Terms of Service (SAAS), if applicable) which
      respectively govern the technical support services and/or
      software-as-a-service solutions provided by RECON-AI to Customer
      (“<b>Services</b>”) (together, the “<b>Agreement</b>”). In the event that
      any terms and conditions contained herein are in conflict with the terms
      and conditions set forth in the Agreement, the terms and conditions set
      forth in this Addendum shall be deemed to be the controlling terms and
      conditions. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the
      meaning given to them in the Agreement. In the course of providing the
      Services to Customer pursuant to the Agreement, RECON-AI may process
      personal data on behalf of Customer. This Addendum sets out the additional
      terms, requirements and conditions on which RECON-AI will process personal
      data as far as such processing relates to the performance of the Services.
      <h4><b>PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA</b></h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Roles of the Parties. The parties acknowledge that for the purposes of
          the Data Protection Legislation and solely in respect of personal data
          submitted by or on behalf of Customer to RECON-AI for processing in
          the course of providing the Services, Customer is the controller and
          RECON-AI is the processor. As used in this Addendum, “<b
            >Data Protection Legislation</b
          >” means (i) all applicable privacy and data protection laws including
          the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) (the
          “<b>GDPR</b>”). Where used in this Addendum, the terms
          “<b>controller</b>”, “<b>processor</b>”, “<b>data subject</b>”, “<b
            >personal data</b
          >”, “<b>personal data breach</b>” and “<b>processing</b>” (including
          “<b>process</b>”) shall have the meanings given to them or to similar
          terms in the applicable Data Protection Legislation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Details of Processing. Both parties will comply with all applicable
          requirements of the Data Protection Legislation. Customer appoints
          RECON-AI as a processor to process such personal data on behalf of
          Customer, and in accordance with Customer’s documented instructions.
          The scope of such instructions are initially defined by the Agreement.
          RECON-AI shall inform Customer if, in its opinion, an instruction
          infringes the Data Protection Legislation, or if it cannot comply with
          Customer’s documented instructions for whatever reason. In any such
          case, the parties shall work together to find an alternative. If
          RECON-AI notifies Customer that neither the instruction nor an
          alternative is feasible, Customer may terminate the affected Services
          in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. Any previously accrued
          rights and obligations will survive such termination. Customer
          acknowledges that certain specific instructions may result in
          additional fees payable by Customer to RECON-AI for carrying out those
          instructions. Annex A sets out the scope, nature and purpose of
          processing by RECON-AI, the duration of the processing and the types
          of personal data and categories of data subject.
        </li>
        <li>
          Customer Responsibilities. Customer will ensure that it has all
          necessary appropriate consents and notices in place to enable lawful
          transfer of the personal data to RECON-AI for the duration and
          purposes of this Addendum. Customer shall not cause RECON-AI to
          violate any applicable laws in its processing of the personal data in
          accordance with Customer’s instructions.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4><b>2. SECURITY</b></h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Security Measures. RECON-AI shall ensure that is has in place
          appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect against a
          personal data breach”), appropriate to the harm that might result from
          the personal data breach and the nature of the data to be protected,
          having regard to the state of technological development and the cost
          of implementing any measures. Such measures are set out in Appendix 2
          of Annex B.
        </li>
        <li>
          Breach Notification. RECON-AI shall, to the extent permitted by law,
          notify Customer without undue delay upon discovery of a personal data
          breach that is connected to Customer.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4><b>3. Personnel.</b></h4>
      RECON-AI shall ensure that all personnel who process, or have access to,
      personal data have committed themselves to keep the personal data
      confidential in accordance with RECON-AI’s confidentiality obligations
      under the Agreement.
      <h4><b>4. Cooperation with Customers.</b></h4>
      Taking into account the nature of the processing and the information
      available to RECON-AI, RECON-AI shall reasonably assist Customer, at
      Customer’s expense, in responding to any request from a data subject
      exercising its rights (such as rights to rectification, erasure, blocking,
      accessing their personal data, objection, restriction of processing, data
      portability, and the right not to be subject to automated decision making)
      and in responding to any inquiries from, or communicating with, a data
      protection regulator or data subject (including with regard to a personal
      data breach), and in ensuring compliance with its obligations under the
      Data Protection Legislation with respect to security, breach
      notifications, impact assessments and consultations with supervisory
      authorities or regulators.
      <h4><b>5. Return and Deletion of Personal Data. </b></h4>
      At the written direction of Customer, RECON-AI shall delete or return
      personal data and copies thereof to Customer following termination of the
      Agreement unless required by applicable law (including any Data Protection
      Legislation) to store the personal data.
      <h4><b>6. AUDIT </b></h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Audit Requirements. The parties acknowledge that Customer must be able
          to assess RECON-AI’s compliance with its obligations under Data
          Protection Legislation, to the extent that RECON-AI is acting as a
          processor on behalf of Customer. Customer further agrees that the
          audits described in Section
        </li>
        <li>
          below meet Customer’s audit requirements, and Customer agrees to
          exercise any right it may have to conduct an inspection or audit
          (including under the Standard Contractual Clauses, as applicable) by
          written notice to RECON-AI to carry out the audits described in
          Section 6.2. As used in this Addendum, “Standard Contractual Clauses”
          means the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for the
          transfer of personal data from the European Union to processors
          established in third countries (controller-to-processor transfers), as
          set out in the Annex to Commission Decision 2010/87/EU, a completed
          copy of which comprises Annex B. 6.2. Audit Procedures. Upon not less
          than thirty (30) days’ advance written notice to RECON-AI and no more
          frequently than once annually, with RECON-AI’s reasonable costs of
          complying with any such request to be met by Customer, RECON-AI shall
          <ol type="i">
            <li>
              make available all information necessary to demonstrate to
              Customer its compliance with Article 28 of the GDPR, including
              without limitation, executive summaries of its information
              security and privacy policies, and
            </li>
            <li>
              cooperate with and respond promptly to Customer’s reasonable
              privacy and/or security questionnaire(s). Notwithstanding the
              above, if Customer’s request for audit occurs during RECON-AI’s
              quarter or year end, or such other time during which RECON-AI
              cannot reasonably accommodate such request, the parties shall
              mutually agree on an extension to the thirty (30) days’ advance
              written notification. Customer shall execute a confidentiality
              agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
              RECON-AI prior to such audit. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
              contained herein will allow Customer to review data pertaining to
              RECON-AI’s other customers or partners. Customer shall bare its
              own costs and expenses with respect to the audits described in
              this Section 6.2. The Parties shall use all reasonable endeavours
              when exercising rights under this Section 6 to minimize disruption
              to RECON-AI’s business activities.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4><b> 7. SUB-PROCESSORS </b></h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Use of Sub-Processors. Customer provides general written authorization
          for:
          <ol type="a">
            <li>RECON-AI to engage the sub-processors,</li>
            <li>
              RECON-AI to engage RECON-AI’s Affiliates as sub-processors and
            </li>
            <li>
              RECON-AI’s Affiliates to engage third-party sub-processors
              (including other Affiliates as sub-processors). For purposes of
              this Addendum, “Affiliate” means an entity controlling, controlled
              by, or under common control with a party. RECON-AI and its
              Affiliates may engage such sub-processors to process personal data
              for the purposes set forth in Section 1 and Annex A, provided
              that:
            </li>
          </ol>
          <ol>
            <li>
              RECON-AI has entered into a written agreement with the third-party
              processor containing data protection terms that require it to
              protect the personal data to the same standard required under this
              Addendum; and
            </li>
            <li>
              RECON-AI remains liable for the acts and omissions of its
              sub-processors to the same extent RECON-AI would be liable if
              performing the Services of each sub-processor directly under the
              terms of this Addendum.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          7.2. Changes to Sub-Processors. If RECON-AI or its Affiliates appoint
          a new (or removes an existing) sub- processor, it shall update the
          list at the Privacy Center. Customer may opt in to receiving alerts
          regarding such list updates via the mechanism set out at the Privacy
          Center, and, provided Customer has done so, RECON-AI will send an
          email publicizing the change, to the email address the Customer has
          provided at the Privacy Center. Customer may object to RECON-AI’s
          appointment or replacement of a sub-processor, provided Customer
          notifies RECON-AI in writing of its specific objection within thirty
          (30) days of receiving such notification from RECON-AI. If Customer
          does not object within such period, the addition of the new
          sub-processor shall be deemed accepted. If Customer does object to the
          addition of a new sub-processor and RECON-AI, in its reasonable
          opinion, cannot reasonably accommodate Customer’s objection, Customer
          may terminate the affected Service(s) upon written notice to RECON-AI.
          Any previously accrued rights and obligations will survive such
          termination. The parties agree that the copies of the sub-processor
          agreements that must be provided by RECON-AI to Customer of the
          Standard Contractual Clauses may have all commercial information, or
          clauses unrelated to the Standard Contractual Clauses or their
          equivalent, removed by RECON-AI beforehand. RECON-AI will provide such
          copies in a manner to be determined in its sole discretion, upon
          request by Customer.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4><b> 8. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA</b></h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Transfers Outside the EEA. If RECON-AI transfers any personal data
          under this Addendum out of the European Economic Area (“EEA”),
          RECON-AI will take such measures as are necessary to ensure the
          transfer is in compliance with the Data Protection Legislation. Such
          measures may include, without limitation, transferring the personal
          data to a recipient
          <ol type="i">
            <li>
              in a country that the European Commission has decided provides
              adequate protection for personal data;
            </li>
            <li>
              that has achieved binding corporate rules authorization in
              accordance with Applicable Data Protection Legislation;
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Standard Contractual Clauses. To the extent that RECON-AI processes
          any personal data under this Addendum that originates from the EEA in
          a country that has not been designated by the European Commission or
          Swiss Federal Data Protection Authority (as applicable) as providing
          an adequate level of protection for personal data, the parties agree
          to enter into the Standard Contractual Clauses which are hereby
          incorporated into and form part of this Agreement in the form set out
          in Annex B to provide adequate protection (within the meaning of the
          Data Protection Legislation) for such personal data. RECON-AI shall be
          deemed the “data importer” and Customer the “data exporter” under the
          Standard Contractual Clauses, and the parties will comply with their
          respective obligations under the Standard Contractual Clauses. If the
          European Commission subsequently amends the Standard Contractual
          Clauses at a later date, such amended terms will supersede and replace
          any Standard Contractual Clauses executed between the parties.
        </li>
        <li>
          Alternative Data Export Solution. The parties agree that the data
          export solution identified in Section 8.2 will not apply if and to the
          extent that Customer adopts an alternative data export solution for
          the lawful transfer of personal data (as recognized under the Data
          Protection Legislation) outside of the EEA, in which event, Customer
          shall reasonably cooperate with RECON-AI to implement such solution
          and such alternative data export solution will apply instead (but
          solely to the extent such alternative data export solution extends to
          the territories to which personal data is transferred under this
          Addendum).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4><b>9. MISCELLANEOUS</b></h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Entire Agreement. This Addendum shall replace and supersede any
          existing data processing addendum, attachment or exhibit (including
          any Standard Contractual Clauses) between the parties.
        </li>
        <li>
          Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement
          or this Addendum, the liability of each party and each party’s
          Affiliates under this Addendum shall be subject to the exclusions and
          limitations of liability set out in the Agreement or, in the absence
          of such a provision in the Agreement, the following will apply:
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              in no event will either party’s maximum aggregate liability
              arising out of or related to the Agreement or this Addendum,
              exceed the total amount paid or payable to RECON-AI under the
              Agreement during the twelve (12) month period preceding the date
              of initial claim, and
            </li>
            <li>
              neither party will have any liability to the other party for any
              loss of profits or revenues, loss of goodwill, loss or corruption
              of data or for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential or
              punitive damages arising out of, or in connection with the

        <li>
          If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in
          accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of
          a breach by the data importer or his subprocessor of any of their
          obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data
          exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has

          The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing
          operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses
          without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data
          importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the
          consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written
          agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on
          the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the
          Clauses. Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection
          obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall
          remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the
          subprocessor's obligations under such agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          The prior written contract between the data importer and the
          subprocessor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause
          as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able
          to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of
          Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they
          have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have
          become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal
          obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by
          operation of law. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall
          be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.
        </li>
        <li>
          The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing
          of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the
          law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.
        </li>
        <li>
          The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements

          transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall
          destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it
          has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer
          prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal
          data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it
          will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred
          and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.

        <li>
          The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of

      <ol>
        <li>
          License Grant. Subject to all limitations and restrictions contained
          herein and the Quote, Service Provider grants Customer a term
          subscription, software as a service (‘SaaS’), nonexclusive, and
          nontransferable right to access and operate the object code form of
          Applications (and use its Documentation) as hosted by Service Provider
          as described in the Quote (“Use”) and solely to perform those
          functions described in the Documentation. For clarity, an
          “Application” means Service Provider’s proprietary software that is
          specifically licensed to Customer pursuant to a Quote.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use. Customer will have a limited right and license to Use the
          Application solely for its internal business purposes, to perform the
          functions described in the Documentation. Customer shall not allow any
          website that is not fully owned by Customer to frame, syndicate,
          distribute, replicate, or copy any portion of Customer’s web site that
          provides direct or indirect access to the Application. Customer shall
          not allow any website, that is not fully owned by Customer, to frame,
          syndicate, distribute, replicate, or copy any portion of Customer’s
          web site that provides direct or indirect access to the Software.
          Unless otherwise expressly permitted in the Quote and subject to
          Section 1.5, Customer shall not permit any subsidiaries, affiliated
          companies, or third parties to access the Software
        </li>
        <li>
          License Type. Unless otherwise specifically stated in the Quote, the
          type of license granted is a per Staff User Account. Customer shall
          ensure that the number of the active Staff User Accounts is equal to
          or less than the number of Staff User Accounts for which the Customer
          has subscribed. Customer is responsible for ensuring that access to a
          Staff User Account is not shared. Only one individual may authenticate
          to one Staff User Account. Hardware or software Customer uses to pool
          connections, reroute information, or reduce the number of users that
          directly access or use the Software does not reduce the number of
          licenses or active Staff User Accounts Customer needs. A “Staff User
          Account” subscription license means that the Application licensed
          pursuant to the Quote may be Used by a limited number of individual
          users, each identified by a unique user id the maximum number of which
          is specified in the Quote. Customer may designate different Staff User
          Accounts at any time without notice to Service Provider so long as the
          permitted number of Staff User Account is not exceeded.

          conditions may be requested from Service Provider and are made a part
          of and incorporated by reference into these SaaS Terms. By accepting
          these SaaS Terms, Customer is also accepting the additional terms and
          conditions, if any, set forth therein.

          SAAS Services Order Form (“Order Form”) for the Services in accordance
          with the terms therein (the “Fees”). If Customer’s use of the Services
          requires the payment of additional fees (per the terms of this
          Agreement), Customer shall be billed for such usage and Customer
          agrees to pay the additional fees in the manner provided herein.
          RECON-AI reserves the right to change the Fees or applicable charges
          and to institute new charges and Fees at the end of the Initial
          Service Term or then‑current renewal term, upon thirty (30) days prior
          notice to Customer (which may be sent by email). If Customer believes
          that RECON-AI has billed Customer incorrectly, Customer must contact
          RECON-AI no later than 60 days after the closing date on the first
          billing statement in which the error or problem appeared, in order to
          receive an adjustment or credit. Inquiries should be directed to
          RECON-AI’s customer support department. RECON-AI will not be required
          to refund the Fee under any circumstances.
        </li>
        <li>
          Invoices. RECON-AI may choose to bill through an invoice, in which
          case, full payment for invoices issued in any given month must be
          received by RECON-AI thirty (30) days after the mailing date of the
          invoice. Unpaid amounts are subject to a finance charge of 10% per
          month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law,
          whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection and may result in
          immediate termination of Service.
        </li>
        <li>
          Taxes. All Fees are exclusive of taxes, levies, and duties, and
          Customer will be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies,
          and duties, including value-added tax (VAT), withholding, or similar

        <li>
          Effect of Nonpayment. RECON-AI may suspend Customer’s access to the
          Services without advanced notice if Customer fails to pay any invoice
          in full when due. In addition to such other rights as RECON-AI may
          have, including without limitation pursuant to Section 5 below,
          Customer shall continue to pay fees during any suspension. Customer
          will reimburse any costs or expenses (including, but not limited to,
          reasonable legal fees) incurred by RECON-AI to collect any overdue
          amount. RECON-AI may accept any check or payment in any amount without
          prejudice to its right to recover the balance or to pursue any other
          right or remedy. Customer may not withhold amounts due to RECON-AI
          under this Agreement for any reason or offset them against amounts
          that Customer asserts are owed to Customer by RECON-AI.

      </ol>
      <h4><b>5 TERMS AND TERMINATION</b></h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Effect of Nonpayment. RECON-AI may suspend Customer’s access to the

        <li>
          In addition to any other remedies it may have, either party may
          terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ notice (or without
